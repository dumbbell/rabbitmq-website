[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) is a binary protocol
emphasising lightweight publish / subscribe messaging,
targeted towards clients in constrained devices. It has
well defined messaging semantics for publish / subscribe,
but not for other messaging idioms.

RabbitMQ supports MQTT 3.1 via a [plugin](mqtt.html).
