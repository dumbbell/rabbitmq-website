## <a id="stomp" class="anchor" href="#stomp">STOMP</a>

[STOMP](http://stomp.github.io/) is a text-based
messaging protocol emphasising (protocol) simplicity. It
defines little in the way of messaging semantics, but is
easy to implement and very easy to implement partially (it's
the only protocol that can be used by hand over telnet).

RabbitMQ supports STOMP (all current versions) via
a [plugin](stomp.html).
